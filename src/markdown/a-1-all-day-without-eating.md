## Description

Through the REACH AoK tool key informants are asked multiple questions regarding the accessibility of food in the area, including the need and use of coping strategies. This indicator represents the use of a coping strategy where household's may go an entire day without eating at all, this is deemed necessary by the household due to a reduced level of access to food in the area.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Using this coping strategy is a reliable proxy for the level of food access in the area. Identifying spikes in coping strategies being used can be indicative of a reduction in food availability or access.
