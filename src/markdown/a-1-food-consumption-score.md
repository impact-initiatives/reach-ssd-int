## Description

The Food Consumption Score (FCS) is a composite score based on dietary diversity, food frequency, and relative nutritional importance of different food groups. It measures the quantity of food consumed. The FCS is also able to capture both dietary diversity and food frequency over the previous seven days. It is considered a core indicator by WFP Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (VAM) and Integrated Phase Classification (IPC).

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

The Food Consumption Score (FCS) is a standard module in the Food Security and Nutrition Monitoring System (FSNMS) and included in most Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) surveys. Further, it is recognised by the IPC as a direct food consumption outcome indicator. The FCS is typically reliable for distinguishing between the lower phases in the IPC, however, as food security worsens the FCS becomes less reliable. As a result, analysing FCS for households in phase 1, 2 and 3, is standard, however, for phases 4 and 5 other indicators are needed, such as the Household Hunger Score (HHS).
