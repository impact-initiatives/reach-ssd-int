## Description

The Household Diet Diversity Score (HDDS) is an indicator designed for measuring food access and used to understand the quality of food consumed. It was developed under the Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance Project (FANTA) project and is considered a proxy indicator for socio-economic status. The indicator provides insight into the macro- and micronutrients consumed by households. It asks households which of the 12 food groups were consumed in the previous 24 hours. The Food Consumption Score (FCS) and HDDS can be calculated from the same module in the survey.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

The Household Diet Diversity Score (HDDS) is a standard module in the Food Security and Nutrition Monitoring System (FSNMS) and included in most Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions (SMART) surveys. Further, it is recognised by the Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) as a direct food consumption outcome indicator. The HDDS is typically more reliable for distinguishing between the lower IPC phases, but still has reasonable correlation with higher phase classifications.
