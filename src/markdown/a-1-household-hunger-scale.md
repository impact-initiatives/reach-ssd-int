## Description

The Household Hunger Scale (HHS) is unique in having been internationally developed and validated for cross-cultural use. The HHS consists of three questions and three frequencies that, when administered in a population-based household survey, allows for estimating the per cent of households affected by three different severities of household hunger:

1. Little to no household hunger
2. Moderate household hunger
3. Severe household hunger

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

The Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) system recognizes the Household Hunger Scale as the only direct food availability / access indicator that can distinguish between IPC phase 4 and phase 5. Studies have shown it is more sensitive to severe levels of food insecurity (phases 3, 4 and 5) in comparison to the Food Consumption Score (FCS), which is better at distinguishing between households at the lower stages of food insecurity (phases 1, 2 and 3).
