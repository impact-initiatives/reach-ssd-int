## Description

The hunger shock question was developed by REACH in 2017 after comprehensive research into the effect of shocks and community perceptions of hunger in comparison to previous years. If a key informant reports there is inadequate access to food in the settlement, the key informant is asked to describe the level of hunger and food access. There are five possible answers:

1. Almost no hunger
2. Hunger is small, strategies are available to cope with the reduced access to food
3. Hunger is bad, limited options to cope with the reduced access to food
4. Hunger is the worst it can be, all over the settlement, and causing many deaths
5. I don't know or don't want to answer

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

The hunger shock indicator is a reliable proxy for understanding the perception of hunger on a monthly basis across a vast portion of the country. While it is not as comprehensive or globally tested as other food availability/access outcome indicators, such as the Food Consumption Score (FCS), Household Diet Diversity Score (HDDS) or Household Hunger Scale (HHS), it has generally trended in the same direction as more complex indicators and allows for a month on month comparison at the county level.
