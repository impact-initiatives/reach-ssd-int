## Description

The REACH Area of Knowledge (AoK) survey asks key informants if there is adequate access to food in the settlement. A simple binary question (yes or no) that is indicative of general perception of food availability / access in the settlement. Follow up questions are used to triangulate the severity and drivers of inadequate access to food.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

REACH's Area of Knowledge (AoK) adequate access to food question has been regularly collected for multiple years, allowing for more in-depth trend analysis and understanding of upward spikes in reported areas with inadequate access to food. When examined alone the question does not provide much subsistence, but when considered along with other indicators the question can guide triangulation of level of food availability / access.
