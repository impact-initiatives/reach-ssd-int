## Description

Food sources are instrumental in defining livelihood profiles, and to establish which households are more affected by a given shock (i.e. if prices increase households depending on food purchases would be more affected). REACH's Area of Knowledge (AoK) survey ask key informants the primary source of food for the settlement and can indicative of sustainable versus unsustainable sources of food. Unsustainable sources include:

1. Humanitarian assistance, including food for assets (FFA) or cash for assets (CFA)
2. Government food distribution
3. Foraged for wild foods
4. Given by family, friends or other local people

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Reliability and sustainability of food sources should be always be considered. Households relying on food aid or gift could have a good food security profile at the time of the assessment, but their food sources are not sustainable. In a protracted crisis, such as South Sudan, it is increasingly common for households to rely on unsustainable food source for part or all the year. Therefore, it is essential to monitor trends / spikes relating to over-reliance on unsustainable food sources.
