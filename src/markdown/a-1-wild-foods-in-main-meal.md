## Description

Monitoring the quantity and quality of wild foods derives from research regarding wild food consumption and South Sudanese diet. According to multiple reports, including Oxfam's report on wild foods in South Sudan, and assessments, it is common for HHs to depend on wild foods, particularly during the lean season. Through the REACH AoK tool key informants are asked multiple questions about wild food consumption in the settlement, including the proportion of meals that include of wild foods.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Over-reliance on wild foods for the primary source of food is unsustainable and can lead to health issues. The proportion of main meals that included wild foods allows for trend analysis and identifying spikes in over-reliance on wild foods which can be indicative of a reduction in food availability and/or access.
