## Description

Monitoring the quantity and quality of wild foods derives from research regarding wild food consumption and South Sudanese diet. According to multiple reports, including Oxfam's report on wild foods in South Sudan, and assessments, it is common for HHs to depend on wild foods, particularly during the lean season. Through the REACH AoK tool key informants are asked multiple questions about wild food consumption in the settlement, including the proportion of meals that include wild foods, and the consumption of any wild foods that make people sick. This is a composite indicator, combining both the responses of whether wild foods are making people sicks, and if wild foods are the main meal for the respondent.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Over-reliance on wild foods for the primary source of food is unsustainable and can lead to health issues, and where the consumption of wild foods that are known to be dangerous to people's health is a reliable proxy for the level of food insecurity in the area. The proportion of main meals that included wild foods allows for trend analysis and identifying spikes in over-reliance on wild foods which can be indicative of a reduction in food availability and/or access. In addition, identifying spikes in consumption of hazardous wild foods can be indicative of a reduction in food availability or access.
