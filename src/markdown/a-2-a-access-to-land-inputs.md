## Description

REACH AoK data is used to ask key informants the ability of people in the settlement to access to land and the necessary inputs (seeds, tools, fertilisers) for cultivation. However, the indicator does not reflect indicator how much area the settlement may have cultivated. The indicator is collected on a monthly basis.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Majority of HHs in South Sudan practice some form of cultivation. It is essential to have some indication of if HHs are cultivating, including if they have agricultural inputs. CFSAM data is necessary for understanding crop production, but it is only released once a year, which is unreliable for real-time tracking system.
