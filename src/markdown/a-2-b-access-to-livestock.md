## Description

Monthly REACH AoK data is used to ask key informants the ability of people in the settlement to access the cattle. To prevent from classifying counties that do not usually own cattle, when 50% or more of assessed settlements report owning cattle than the indicator is analysed.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Livestock is a crucial part of pastoral and agro-pastoralists in South Sudan. Livestock is both a source of food and socio-economic standing in the community. A substantial reduction in access to livestock can limit an HHs ability to cope with shocks and access to food.
