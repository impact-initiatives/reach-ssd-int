## Description

FAO publishes ad-hoc fact sheets on the number of different confirmed livestock disease outbreaks. The indicator does not focus on the number of individual cases, but recognised outbreaks of diseases. The data is a proxy for the severity of livestock disease in a county.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Livestock is a crucial part of pastoral and agro-pastoralists in South Sudan. Livestock is both a source of food and socio-economic standing in the community. A substantial reduction in access to livestock can limit an HHs ability to cope with shocks and access to food.
