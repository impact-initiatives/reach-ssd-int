## Description

If key informants reported the presence of livestock disease(s), a follow question is asked about the impact that the disease(s) has on the ability to access food. The answer choices included:

1. No impact
2. Small impact
3. Large impact
4. I don't know or don't want to answer

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Livestock is a crucial part of pastoral and agro-pastoralists in South Sudan. Livestock is both a source of food and socio-economic standing in the community. An outbreak of disease can lead to an increase in livestock mortality, changing migration patterns, human disease, and reduction in household assets.
