## Description

Monthly REACH AoK data is used to ask key informants the level of ownership of cattle.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Livestock is a crucial part of pastoral and agro-pastoralists in South Sudan. Livestock is both a source of food and socio-economic standing in the community. A substantial reduction in livestock ownership can limit a household's ability to cope with shocks and access to food.
