## Description

Access to market refers to physical access to a market where people can buy and sell products, including food, agricultural inputs and non-food items. Functioning markets are characterised by the existence of competition (between sellers as well as buyers), and availability of information.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Physical access to functioning markets allows people to satisfy some of their basic needs through trade, thereby improving their basic needs through trade, thus improving their living standards and food security.
