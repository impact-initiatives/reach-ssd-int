## Description

If key informants reported an increase in cereal prices, there is a follow question about the impact that the increase in cereal prices have on the ability to access food. The answer choices included:

1. No impact
2. Small impact
3. Large impact
4. I don't know or don't want to answer

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

REACH's Shocks report (2018) provided clear insight into the effect shocks, acute and cumulative, can have on a populations ability to access food. key informants discussed in detail how it is almost always a combination of shocks that send HHs to periods of extreme hunger. The cereal price shock can be indicative of the perceptions key informants have on how prices shocks can affect a settlements ability to access food, particularly for areas that are highly dependent on markets.
