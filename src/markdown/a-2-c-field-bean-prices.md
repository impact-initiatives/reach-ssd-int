## Description

The indicator compares the price collected at major markets to previous month price. Accounting for seasonality helps to differentiate between normal seasonal variations in availability and cost and additional changes which can be considered abnormal, depending on the magnitude of those changes. Since data cannot be collected at every market, the indicator looks at the primary market in or near the county.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Understanding financial access to markets is crucial. South Sudan has faced significant economic turmoil for the last five years, and inflation continues to be a severe concern. Cash programming is increasing but understanding where market needs are critical is essential for actors. WFP VAM, FAO and REACH collect and consolidate market prices for major trading hubs which are used as a proxy for prices in counties.
