## Description

The indicator compares the ToT at major markets to previous month ToT. The indicator monitors the ability of livestock owners to trade for staple crops. Accounting for seasonality helps to differentiate between normal seasonal variations in availability and price and additional changes which can be considered abnormal, depending on the magnitude of those changes. Since data cannot be collected at every market, the indicator looks at the primary market in or near the county.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Understanding financial access to markets is crucial. South Sudan has faced significant economic turmoil for the last five years, and inflation continues to be a severe concern. Livestock markets are essential to monitor, particularly for pastoral livelihood zones. The collapse of livestock markets can be a strong indication of severe food insecurity, as people are selling more goats at a relatively lower price to purchase staple foods.
