## Description

The indicator examines the crop production relative to the five-year average. A significant deviation from the five-year average, more substantial than the average deficit or lower than regular surplus, is observed as equally important.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Crop production is critical to understanding current and future needs. While crop production in parts of the country has been suppressed for multiple years, it is still crucial to understand the relative level of crop production (deficit or surplus) that counties have relative to the five-year average. The corresponding output is used because some counties have always been net buyers or net sellers and have adapted to these expectations. Therefore, a reduction in relative production can be just as severe for a net seller as a net buyer.
