## Description

The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a simple graphical indicator that can be used to analyse remote sensing measurements and assess whether the target being observed contains live green vegetation or not. In particular look for periods with consistently above or below average NDVI, particularly during the early stages of the season and during critical times for crop development.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

NDVI coverage is monitored by agencies and is a key indicator to understanding the effects of rainfall on crop production and available grazing resources for livestock. A large decrease in NDVI coverage, typically below 90% of the average, can be indicative of scarcer resources and/or lower crop production.
