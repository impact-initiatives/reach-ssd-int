## Description

The LCS is a threshold indicator that is often used as a proxy for the level of livelihood change and severity of coping strategies used by HHs to access food. HHs are asked which strategies were used to fill consumption gaps in the previous 30 days due to a lack of food in the household. The strategies are contextualized for the livelihood zones and ranked for severity, "stressed", "crisis", and "emergency".

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

The LCS is recognised by the IPC as a direct food consumption outcome indicator and is indicative of livelihood change. Affected households may use coping strategies to mitigate a reduced access food. The severity of coping strategies can have long term effects on a HHs productivity and resilience to future shocks. Understanding the extent to which coping strategies are used can provide an providing a quick, current status indicator of the degree of food insecurity that is immediately useful for programmatic decision makey informantng. Coping strategies can also me used the measure the impact of humanitarian assistance.
