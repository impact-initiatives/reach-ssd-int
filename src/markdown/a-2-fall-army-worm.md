## Description

FAW is a new pest infestation affecting crops across South Sudan, primarily in Equatorias, Northern Bahr el Ghazel, and parts of Jonglei. The indicator uses FSNMS data and updates from FAO to determine which counties are affected by FAW and the magnitude of the infestation.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

FAW can significantly disrupt crop production, mainly maize and sorghum. Monitoring FAW armyworm infestations can help guide where interventions are needed and provide insight into the expected crop production.
