## Description

Monitoring the quantity and quality of wild foods derives from research regarding wild food consumption and South Sudanese diet. According to multiple reports, including Oxfam's report on wild foods in South Sudan, and assessments, it is common for HHs to depend on wild foods, particularly during the lean season. Through the REACH AoK tool key informants are asked multiple questions about wild food consumption in the settlement, including the consumption of any wild foods that make people sick.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Consumption of wild foods that are known to be dangerous to people's health is a reliable proxy for the level of food insecurity in the area. Identifying spikes in consumption of hazardous wild foods can be indicative of a reduction in food availability or access.
