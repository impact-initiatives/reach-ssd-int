## Description

Monthly REACH AoK data on self-reporting of livestock disease. key informants are asked if there are currently any livestock diseases in the settlement.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Livestock is a crucial part of pastoral and agro-pastoralists in South Sudan. Livestock is both a source of food and socio-economic standing in the community. An outbreak of disease can lead to an increase in livestock mortality, changing migration patterns, human disease, and reduction in household assets.
