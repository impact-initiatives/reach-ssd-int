## Description

Monthly REACH AoK data is used to ask key informants the if coping strategies are used within the area. And this indicator refers to the use of selling the possession of livestock as a direct coping strategy.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Livestock is a crucial part of pastoral and agro-pastoralists in South Sudan. Livestock is both a source of food and socio-economic standing in the community. A substantial reduction in livestock ownership can limit a household's ability to cope with shocks and access to food.
