## Description

After the results of the IPC Acute Food Insecurity Situation are published, they take priority over proxy indicators used otherwise. The current analysis, made using data that was collected during that time, is used for the current month plus the following one. For example, if January is the current period, the results from that analysis will be used in the INT for January and February. Because publishing of the IPC results can be delayed until the month following the analysis period, extending the use of that data by a month ensures it is utilized by the system for current needs analysis.

After the 2 month period for the current analysis, the results of the first and second projection are used as a baseline for proxy indicators. The first projections are used for the 3rd - 4th months after the current period, with the second projection being used for 5th - 7th months after the current period. Due to the varying availability of proxy indicators collected on a monthly basis, these projections define a minimum level of risk in the period between IPC analysis.
