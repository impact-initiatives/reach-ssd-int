## Description

AWD cases and death rates are collected monthly through WHO's EWARS database. Health experts have established thresholds and contextualised for South Sudan. It is also vital to ensure health indicators are relative to the county population and access to health facilities and counties with smaller populations are not bypassed because the absolute caseload numbers are not as high.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Diarrhoeal disease is the second leading cause of death in children under five years old. Diarrhoea is defined as the passage of 3 or more loose or liquid stools per day. The indicator looks at both number of cases and death rate per caseload which can also be viewed as a proxy for the health infrastructure (i.e. the higher the death rate, the more likely the current health facility is incapable of handling the caseload). It can also be used as a proxy for WASH conditions and food utilisation, both of which can be attributable to GAM prevalence.
