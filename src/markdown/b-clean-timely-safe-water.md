## Description

The access to clean water indicator is from REACH AoK data. The indicator is paired with the percentage of HHs with access to CTSW to gauge any changes in access to water at the county level. The indicator takes the FSNMS data as the baseline access to water for the given season (i.e. dry or rainy), and the AoK data is aggregated to the county level and compared with the baseline. Any major trends, observed through differences between the two indicators, are accounted for and represented in the indicator classification. Counties that already have negligible access to clean water (i.e. counties with access to CTSW of 5%) will remain at emergency levels unless AoK data can strongly warrant a decrease in the indicator classification.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Access to clean water is crucial to understanding the risk of water-borne diseases and food utilisation. Further, there is unlikely to be substantial changes in access to water in the same season. However, it is still important to monitor trends on a monthly basis through AoK data compared to HH level baseline collected during FSNMS.
