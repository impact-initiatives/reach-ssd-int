## Description

An HH is considered to have access to clean, safe and timely water is when the HH uses an improved water source (i.e. boreholes or tap-stand) that is within 30 minutes and safe to access. The data is collected during FSNMS and ad-hoc SMART surveys.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Access to CTSW is crucial for HHs. Clean water effects an individual's ability to absorb critical nutrients in food. Accessible water sources prevent HH members from spending all day collecting water, allowing for time to be spent on other HH responsibilities such as care-taking of children.
