## Description

Percentage of HHs that did not use a latrine or dispose of waste properly in the two weeks before data collection; the indicator doesn't reflect if HHs have access to a latrine.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Open defection exposes HHs to many water-borne diseases, including cholera. Understanding the magnitude of open defecation can increase the exposure a county is to an outbreak of cholera or AWD. An outbreak of either disease can severely affect HHs, including reduced ability to absorb nutrients, the strain on local health facilities and increased mortality.
