## Description

The perceived usage of latrines indicator is from REACH AoK data. The indicator is paired with the percentage of HHs that engage in open defecation to analyse trends access to water at the county level. The indicator takes the FSNMS data as the baseline latrine usage for the given season (i.e. dry or rainy), and the AoK data is aggregated to the county level and compared with the baseline. Any major trends, observed through differences between the two indicators, are accounted for and represented in the indicator classification. Counties that already primarily practice open defecation (i.e. counties with open defecation at 90%) will remain at emergency levels unless AoK data can strongly warrant a decrease in the indicator classification.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Open defecation is strongly linked to disease outbreaks and water contamination, indirectly affecting the individual's ability to absorb critical nutrients.
