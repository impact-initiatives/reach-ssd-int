## Description

Rainfall data is measured through the WFP Dataviz online portal which aggregated CHIPS remote rainfall sensing. Monthly information is then compared with the long- term mean observe any anomalies, including potential flood or dry spells.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Rainfall is crucial for all livelihoods in South Sudan. Dry spells can limit crop production and force cattle to migrate further than usual to find water and grazing land. Excessive rainfall can lead to outbreaks of pest that damage crops, spread livestock disease, and cause road closures, limiting supplies to remote locations.
