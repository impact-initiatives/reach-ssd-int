## Description

ARI cases and death rates are collected monthly through WHO's EWARS database. Health experts have established thresholds and contextualised for South Sudan. It is also vital to ensure health indicators are relative to the county population and access to health facilities and counties with smaller populations are not bypassed because the absolute caseload numbers are not as high.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

TBD
