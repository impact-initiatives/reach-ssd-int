## Description

Confirmed Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) case(s) will be from the WHO. Health experts have been established thresholds and contextualised for South Sudan. Unlike AWD and Malaria, death rates are not used, due to the severity of just a few deaths attributable to confirmed cholera cases.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Ebola is a extremely dangerous virus that will likely result in border closures and break down of social structures in the country. As a result, it must be carefully monitored and given the highest priority for health implications.
