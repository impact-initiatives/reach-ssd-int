## Description

Malaria cases and death rates are collected monthly through WHO's EWARS database. Health experts have established thresholds and contextualised for South Sudan. It is also vital to ensure health indicators are relative to the county population and access to health facilities and counties with smaller populations are not bypassed because the absolute caseload numbers are not as high.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

The indicator looks at both number of cases and death rate per caseload which can also be viewed as a proxy for the health infrastructure (i.e. the higher the death rate, the more likely the current health facility is incapable of handling the caseload). It can also be used as a proxy for WASH conditions and can be attributable to GAM prevalence.
