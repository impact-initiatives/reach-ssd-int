## Description

Measles caseloads and attributable mortality are collected monthly through WHO's EWARS database. Health experts have established thresholds and contextualised for South Sudan. Unlike AWD and Malaria, death rates are not used, due to the severity of just a few deaths attributable to confirmed cholera cases.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Measles is considered an severe disease that can lead to high mortality rates among children, actively drive GAM prevalence, and a reliable proxy for poor, deteriorating food insecurity and shelter conditions.
