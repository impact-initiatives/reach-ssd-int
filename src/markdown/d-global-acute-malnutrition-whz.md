## Description

GAM prevalence (WHZ) measures the severity of wasting and nutritional status in children age 6-59 months, which is used as an estimation for the target population. The indicator examines the child's deviation from the WHO standards in units of standard deviation (Z-scores); > 2SDs is considered the be malnourished. The indicator is typically collected at the county level and through ad-hoc SMART surveys and bi-annual FSNMS data collection; the nutrition information working group validates the GAM prevalence.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Due to the high level of error checkey informantng and statistical analysis, GAM (WHZ) is the most reliable indicator for measuring wasting and nutrition status for children 6-59 months. Since malnutrition a lag indicator, a high GAM prevalence is a strong signal that significant issues are affecting the population's nutritional intake, potentially through high morbidity, low food availability or poor utilisation.
