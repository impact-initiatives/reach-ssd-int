## Description

The REACH AoK question ask key informants to estimate the percentage of children and elderly that are malnourished in the settlement. The question is perception based and does not provide direct evidence of the prevalence of malnutrition or admission to OTP sites. It is collected on a monthly basis and is considered the least reliable of the nutrition indicators. The indicator can only be used if related AoK indicators are also flagged. Quality Criteria (Minimum of 1 condition triggered):

1. Health conceptual indicator at or above Alert
2. FSL conceptual indicator at or above Alert
3. Mortality conceptual indicator at or above Alert

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Nutritional status is critical for understanding the severity of a location; however, GAM prevalence (WHZ) or proxy GAM (MUAC) collection times are ad-hoc, preventing regular monitoring of potential deterioration of nutritional status. Analysing new nutrition admission can be indicative of spikes in nutrition admissions and stress on current nutrition infrastructure.
