## Description

MUAC measures the circumference of the mid-upper arm of children 6 - 59 months as a proxy for nutrition status; less than 125mm is considered to be malnourished and less than 115 is considered to be severely malnourished. The indicator is typically collected at the county level, through ad-hoc SMART surveys or during rapid assessments in catchment zones. MUAC is considered less reliable for giving a precise and accurate than WHZ for estimating nutrition status of the target population but is still a reliable indicator.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Since malnutrition is a lag indicator, a high GAM prevalence is a strong signal that significant issues are affecting the population's nutritional intake, potentially through high morbidity, low food availability or poor utilisation.
