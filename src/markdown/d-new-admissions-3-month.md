## Description

When GAM prevalence or proxy GAM is not available, nutrition admission data can provide an insight into the relative severity of malnutrition through reported caseload. The admission trends versus three-month average examine the current admission trends compared to the three-month average. The indicator uses some of quality criteria to control for False positives, programme expansion and seasonality. The data is considered low reliability, since it does not directly measure malnutrition rates, but it is collected on a regular basis which allows for some extrapolation of county-level nutritional status between SMART surveys and FSNMS data collection. Quality Criteria (required):

1. Minimum of five reporting sides for a current month
2. Minimum of 90% of reporting sites reported for the current month
3. No significant decrease (i.e. 50% or more) in the total number of reporting sites

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Nutritional status is critical for understanding the severity of a location; however, GAM prevalence (WHZ) or proxy GAM (MUAC) collection times are ad-hoc, preventing regular monitoring of potential deterioration of nutritional status. Analysing nutrition admission trends versus the three-month average can help fill the gap between large surveys and monitor for rapid decline.
