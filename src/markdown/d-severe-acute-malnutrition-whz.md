## Description

GAM prevalence (WHZ) measures the severity of wasting and nutritional status in children age 6-59 months, which is used as an estimation for the target population. Prevalence of severe acute malnutrition is 3SDs above the WHO standard or presence of oedema, and it is considered extremely critical that the child is admitted to a feeding program to avoid loss of life. The indicator is typically collected at the county level and through ad-hoc SMART surveys and bi-annual FSNMS data collection; the nutrition information working group validates the GAM prevalence.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Even if other vital indicators are unavailable, a high SAM prevalence is signalling that there are severe life threating issues within the target population and there is likely need for immediate intervention.
