## Description

The perception of increasing mortality indicator is derived monthly from REACH AoK data. The question asks key informants if in the previous 30 days if mortality has been increasing, decreasing or about the same in the settlement.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

CDR and U5CDR are collected on an ad-hoc basis, reducing its relevance for real-time . The perception of increased mortality indicator can provide an indicative insight into perceived mortality rates in a country and allows for a month on month trend analysis.
