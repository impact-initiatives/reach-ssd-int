## Description

The under-five crude death rate is the number of deaths occurring among the under five years old population of a given geographical area during a given year, per 1,000 mid- year total population of the assigned geographic area during the same year. SMART surveys are the primary source for mortality rates.

## Rationale for inclusion in the INT

Mortality rates, such as the CDR, are critical to understanding the severity of a situation. As demonstrated during the Somalia famine in 2011, mortality began to trend upwards months before the actual famine declaration.
