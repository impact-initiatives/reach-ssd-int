## 1. Overview

To design and implement an in-depth needs tracking system that tracks, and highlights needs at the county level across South Sudan. The current Integrated Needs Tracking (INT) system builds from lessons learned from the Somalia Early Warning system, the Household Economic Approach (HEA) framework, and other literature relating to early warning and needs tracking systems. The overall objective is to build a multi-tiered multi-dimension framework that monitors five conceptional indicators (Food Security and Livelihoods, WASH, Health, Nutrition, and Mortality), based on data provided by the four life-saving clusters, FSL, WASH, Health, and Nutrition.

## 2. Background & Rationale

The dynamic and multi-faceted nature of the South Sudanese displacement crisis has created significant challenges for humanitarian information management. As a result of the continued insecurity and overall unpredictability of a sudden onset of humanitarian needs, it is becoming increasingly important to quickly identify and fill information gaps relating to potential areas of severe humanitarian distress in a systematic and timely manner to promote more effective humanitarian response and planning for immediate life-saving activities.

At the Famine Workshop, in February 2018, the cluster leads for FSL, WASH, Health, and Nutrition cluster, and REACH, agreed that there was a need for a better system to timely track the needs of vulnerable populations. Despite multiple agencies regularly conducting assessments, there is not an information management system to house key indicators collected by multiple agencies across the four identified life-saving clusters. Furthermore, there is a lack of a transparent system that the Needs Analysis Working Group (NAWG) can use to quickly identify potential hotspot counties and prioritise them for further discussion. As a result, the Integrated Needs Tracking (INT) system was designed based on lessons learned from the [Somalia early warning system](http://www.fsnau.org/downloads/fsnau-dashboard-linking-early-warning-early-action-somalia), the Household Economic Approach (HEA) framework, and literature on early warning systems. The INT system feeds directly into the NAWG and accessible at any time through an online portal that is available for stakeholders to view whole classifications or filter to specific indicators and themes.

## 3. Objectives

The INT system aims to provide the NAWG and key decision makers with a system that consolidates multiple data sources and critical indicators into one information management system which feeds into a classification decision tree, endorsed by the four life-saving clusters. The INT system provides the NAWG with the ability to identify counties analysis based on recent and reliable data that need further analysis and discussion before being presented to the Inter-Cluster Working Group (ICWG).

### Specific objectives

1.  To act as an information management system for multiple data sources
2.  To use established thresholds to flag potential hotspots for the Needs Analysis Working Group (NAWG) to examine further
3.  To build upon the current model by identifying key indicators that partners need in order to respond to the needs of the affected population more effectively (i.e. Implementing a separate indicator for shocks and displacement based on further research).

## 4. Research Questions

1. What is the current level of food insecurity (availability, access, utilisation and stability), access to livelihoods?
2. What is the current level of access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, to what degree are they utilised, and has there been water-borne related disease outbreaks that have affected the target area?
3. What is the prevalence of core diseases in a specific county (Malaria, Cholera, Acute Watery Diaherra, Measles)?
4. What is the prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM)?
5. What is the crude death rate?

## 5. Methodology

### Overview

The INT system is based on lessons learned from the Somalia Early Warning system. Due to the difficulty of collecting regular data, the INT system is initially designed to be a real-time needs tracking system rather than to provide early warning. However, as the system grows and data sources improve, a second objective of the INT is to document and analyse long-term data to anticipate better and monitor deterioration and provide early warning guidance. The system draws on literature on Famine indicators and the interaction between the five conceptional indicators included (FSL, WASH, Health, Nutrition, and Mortality). The INT system is not expected to be used independently of further analysis or discussion to trigger a response, preferably to be included in the NAWG system for recommendations to the ICWG and HCT for response scale up.

### The Integrated Needs Tracking System concept

As the scale and geographic spread of the humanitarian crisis increase, availability and use of a practical needs monitoring system that integrates available data sources and flags as well as predicts needs of areas experiencing worsening humanitarian conditions in-between IPC analysis. Information management (IM) platform and framework for understanding multi-sectoral 'real time' needs by pulling together data from multiple sources, including FSNMS, SMART, Health, REACH AoK, and remote sensing.

The INT system is designed to assist the NAWG in identifying 'hotspot' counties based on selector needs or overall needs on a monthly basis. The INT uses data that is mainly captured at the settlement or county level. While this data may be considered lower quality, the data is released on a monthly basis, allowing for regular updates between major data releases from the IPC/FSNMS/SMART surveys. The INT system is based on internationally recognised frameworks, protocols and lessons learned documents. Currently, the system focuses on four life-saving clusters, FSL, WASH, Nutrition and Health. It focuses on drivers and outcomes to help distinguish how multiple indicators interact with each other when determining the needs of a particular area. Currently, the INT system focuses on five categories, FSL, WASH, Health, Nutrition, and Mortality with components and sub-components for each category. The INT system uses a threshold approach to classify the various categories and components, 'Not stressed', 'Stressed'. 'Warning', 'Alert', 'Emergency'. When possible thresholds are determined by pre-established thresholds, such as the IPC for food security outcome indicators, or based on technical feedback from sector experts and previous trends.

The INT will have a publicly available online dashboard will be built to allow the user to "unpack" the alert levels, to see what indicator(s) is driving the status. Unpacking alert levels allow the user to make their interpretation of the warning and ensure all actors have the opportunity to verify the accuracy of the alert and ensure there is no miss-prioritisation based on the system.

Overall, the INT system is designed to bridge the gap between large-scale assessments, such as SMART and FSNMS, and analysis periods, such as the IPC. Allowing for the NAWG and partners to understand underlying trends and areas of concern on a regular monthly basis, providing a better source for the NAWG to provide the ICWG evidence-based recommendations.

### County Classification and Indicators

The five conceptual indicators, FSL, WASH, Health, Nutrition and Mortality have been agreed upon with cluster representatives, and have a strong influence from the UNICEF conceptual framework.[^1] The UNICEF framework uses four categories, basic causes, underlying causes, immediate causes and manifestation. As the situation deteriorates, basic causes influence underlying causes which in turn have immediate causes which finally manifest into malnutrition. The INT system follows a similar approach by examining 'drivers', such as limited financial access to markets, poor WASH infrastructure, which considered to be root causes to outcome indicators, such as malnutrition and mortality. Note that within the INT framework, malnutrition is treated as both an outcome and an influencer, since a high prevalence of malnutrition increases morbidity, reduces food utilising
and decreases HH productivity.[^2]

[^1]: Developed in 1998 the UNICEF conceptual framework for malnutrition still plays a fundamental role in multiple frameworks and analysis protocols, including the IPC. https://www.unicef.org/sowc98/silent4.htm)
[^2]: Malnutrition and mortality are usually closely linked. Acute protein-energy malnutrition mainly leads to death by increasing the susceptibility of malnourished individuals to infectious diseases and, once infected, increasing the severity and duration of these diseases.

The INT system classifies counties, using the five conceptual indicators, with data into one of five classifications, Not Triggered, Stressed, Warning, Alert, and Emergency, and a separate classification for counties with no data, see table 1 for description of the classifications. Classifications are based on the number of components and sub-components that are being triggered based on a variety of indicators (See indicator guide for details on each indicator and its decision tree). A county-level emergency classification reflects CDR is at or above 2 or GAM (WHZ) prevalence is at or above 30%; reflecting the outcomes from underlying causes or drivers has already had a significant impact on the county. In the absence of CDR or GAM (WHZ) prevalence, a county can be classified as Emergency if two of the three driver conceptual indicators are passing their respective thresholds for an emergency. In the case of this type of emergency classification, the INT system is triggering that underlying causes or drivers that lead to excess typically malnutrition and mortality. Therefore, it is probable that action is recommended to address the underlying needs of the county, either through FSL, WASH, Health, or a combination of all three. The annexe provides more details on the decision tree for each conceptual indicator and components, along with a detailed guide on indicators used.

### Level of analysis

Although specific geographic tracking of needs would be ideal, currently the availability of reliable and timely data sources used for the INT system is collected at the county level. Therefore, the map is disaggregated to the county level and cannot provide essential needs at the sub-county level. However, the system is designed to allow users to unpack county classifications by conceptual indicators through examining the associated components and sub-components. Unpacking allows the user to make their interpretation of the warning and ensure all actors have the opportunity to verify the accuracy of the alert and ensure there is no miss-prioritisation based on the system. For example, a decision maker may only be interested in where there are WASH emergencies and can filter for only WASH indicators. For details on how the decision tree works see annexe for decision tree breakdown and the thresholds for each indicator.

### Components and sub-components

The system uses a threshold mechanism to determine each classification based on whether a set number of components and sub-components that are triggered based on pre-established thresholds. The thresholds are based on previous frameworks, including the IPC, WFP VAM’s CARI model, FAOs EWEA models for Somalia and technical expert advice. For example, when available FSL indicators follow the IPC or HEA established thresholds. Following internationally recognised norms ensures the system follows best practices and support political buy-in from the relevant technical agencies. When previously established thresholds or expertise advise is unavailable, trend analysis is used to gauge appropriate thresholds. Additionally, every six months when FSNMS and SMART survey data is available for the majority of the country, the INT has a separate decision tree, called the high reliability tree, that is used to assist in calibrating indicators that are not HH level or have pre-established thresholds.[^3] The annexe provides a general outline of the conceptual indicators the respective components and sub-components.

[^3]: For example, when setting thresholds for the hunger shock indicator, REACH AoK data from August was compared to the percentage of HHs in counties that reported HHS of 5-6 (indicative of IPC phase 5 conditions) based on FSNMS data collected during a similar period. Overall, REACH’s hunger shock question was within a 5% range in 35 counties and only overestimated in 3 of the 35 counties. This type of analysis is repeated on a bi-annual basis to continuously calibrate less reliable remote data sources with randomly sampled HH level data.

### Data Reliability

INT indicators are chosen based on key criteria:

#### Timeliness

The fundamental mandate of the integrated needs track system is to provide a countrywide analysis of the critical needs in South Sudan on a monthly basis. As a result, it is crucial that the indicators used are collected on a regular and predictable basis, allowing for the timely release of the INT system each month and enabling trend analysis.

#### Level of analysis/sampling methodology

Data must be representative or able to be extrapolated to the county level. Specific geographic needs tracking is crucial, however, at its current status, the INT system focuses primarily on county- level needs and data sources. If two datasets are collected within the same time frame and have representative data, the INT focal points and NAWG members to examine which data should be used based on the quality of the survey conducted. HH level data sources, such as FSNMS and SMART surveys, are recognised for providing critical information that is representative of the target population. However, due to the ad-hoc and long gap between data collection periods, the information cannot always be used in the INT system. As a result, the INT system is designed to have two decision trees.

#### High reliability

Uses SMART and FSNMS data to provide the most precise and most accurate picture of the level of needs in a country. The high-reliability tree uses globally recognised indicators and thresholds, including Household Hunger Scale (HHS), Food Consumption Score (FCS), Prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) by weight for height Z-score, and crude death rate (CDR). When the data is available high-reliability indicators are used over low-reliability indicators (see section on Indicator inclusion by the tree). However, the data is typically only available 2 times a year, leaving a large information gap between assessments. Therefore, the high-reliability tree is used both to provide in-depth HH level analysis of needs and calibrate the low-reliability tree. Calibration is done by comparing the outcomes of the two decision trees for significant differences and readjust accordingly.

#### Low reliability

To track needs on a monthly basis the low-reliability tree uses indicators that are less representative of the target population but have acceptable methodologies to extrapolate indicative findings at the county level. Theoretically, all the indicators are collected on a monthly basis. The low-reliability tree allows for the INT to bridge the information gap between major HH level assessments, such as FSNMS.

### Data sources

The INT system relies on several different data sources, each aligned with specific conceptual indicators and meet the criteria above. For the monthly updated INT system, considered the low reliability system, the indicators primarily come from remote sensing, including Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) and WFP VAM’s Dataviz portal, REACH AoK data, WFP/REACH market monitoring, crop and food security assessment mission (CFSAM) and the South Sudan livestock market information system (CLIMIS)[^4], nutrition admission trends and health facility admission trends. The indicator guide provides the data source, timeliness and appropriate decision tree(s) for every indicator.

For example:

- Rainfall patterns, including dry spells and excessive rainfall, is considered a key indicator for understanding both current and future needs in a location. Droughts have significant effects on livestock, and flooding can lead to spikes in vector and waterborne diseases.[^5]
- AoK, while not representative at the HH level, is utilised as a proxy and given strong importance in the low-reliability decision tree.
- Admission rates into nutrition feeding programmes and health clinics are reported each month and therefore can support the health indicator being regularly updated and provide support to nutrition through the number of children treated for malnourishment.
- Collection of market prices and rainfall on a monthly bases by WFP VAM, and in quarter 1 of 2019, REACH is set to begin monitoring prices in 15 markets in South Sudan.

High-reliability data sources, such as randomly sampled HH surveys, will primarily come through FSNMS and SMART surveys. Methodologies are generally accepted of these surveys is throughout the country, and the nutrition information working group validates SMART surveys before being distributed publicly. Therefore, when available, the data is automatically accepted and implemented into the appropriate decision trees. Ad-hoc HH level surveys conducted by partner organisations require a more in-depth review of the sampling methodology and indicator calculation before being implemented into the appropriate decision tree.

### Updating the INT system

When data is available, the INT system is updated on a monthly cycle by INT technical focal points. All indicators and data sources were chosen based on timely collection periods and reliability. The foundation of the INT system is to be updated on a monthly basis, allowing for continuous monitoring of counties between major surveys and workshops, such as the IPC. Currently, the system relies directly on requesting data from the respective partner(s) that collect the data for each indicator or collected through online data sources by INT technical focal points. In the long term, the online portal will have a data submission page for cluster IMOs to submit their respective indicators. However, this would require all data providers to understand and follow pre-defined data formatting guidelines, which would require time and training to ensure data formats are understood and inputted correctly. Additionally, IMOs can submit via email to the INT data focal point.

### Future Concepts

#### Shocks index

REACH has already begun to look at how different shocks affects populations through the implementation of shocks related questions in the AoK questionnaire and the April 2018 report on shocks. The report, in particular, analysed how shocks can have varying geographic and social implications. FGD participants discussed how rarely is it a one-off shock that pushes populations to the break of destitution, but a combination of shocks occurring simultaneous of within short time- periods of each other. As a result, there is a need to continue to monitor shocks and understand the implications of each type of shock. Currently, the INT system uses the REACH AoK shock questions to gauge the effects of perceived shocks, such as the effect of an increase in cereal price on a settlement's ability to access food (see indicator guide). However, further research and understanding of these concepts will be explored under a DFID funded grant and implemented into the INT system, via a shocks index.

#### Trend analysis

As the INT system cumulates data and it will become possible to analyse trends across counties. While it is difficult to obtain reliable baselines in South Sudan, some data sources can be compared against time to understand and monitor over time various indicators. Ideally, trend analysis would allow the INT system to flag counties that may not have surpassed certain thresholds but have been quickly deteriorating or improving versus previous months.

#### Bi-annual recalibration

The lower reliability tree is the foundation of the INT system, allowing for monthly updates between IPC updates and ad-hoc SMART surveys. However, we possible, using data from HH level surveys and outcomes from IPC analysis will be used to help recalibrate thresholds and indicators to assure that the INT system aligns correctly with higher reliable data and can be adjusted for seasonality.
