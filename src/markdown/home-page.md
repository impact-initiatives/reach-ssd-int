## 1. Overview

The Integrated Needs Tracking (INT) system is designed to highlight the risk of severity, facilitate analysis, and facilitate prioritisation of needs at the county level across South Sudan. The INT builds from lessons learned from the Food Security and Nutrition Anlysis Unit - Somalia (FSNAU) Early Warning Early Action (EWEA) Dashboard, the Household Economic Approach (HEA) framework, and additional literature relating to early warning and needs tracking systems. The overall objective is to provide a multi-tiered multi-dimensional framework that monitors four conceptual indicators, corresponding to the four life-saving clusters: FSL, WASH, Health, and Nutrition. 


## 2. Background & Rationale

The dynamic and multi-faceted nature of the South Sudanese displacement crisis has created significant challenges for humanitarian information management. As a result of the continued insecurity and overall unpredictability of a sudden onset of humanitarian needs, it is becoming increasingly important to quickly identify and fill information gaps. This is particularly significant relating to potential areas of severe humanitarian distress in a systematic and timely manner, in order to promote more effective humanitarian response and planning for immediate life-saving activities.

At the Famine Prevention Workshop in February 2018, cluster leads for FSL, WASH, Health, and the Nutrition cluster’s, together with REACH, agreed that there was a need for an improved system to timely track the needs of vulnerable populations. Despite multiple agencies regularly conducting assessments, there is not an information management system to house key indicators collected by these agencies across the four identified life-saving clusters. Furthermore, there is a lack of a transparent system that the Needs Analysis Working Group (NAWG) can use to quickly identify potential hotspot counties and prioritise them for further discussion. As a result, the Integrated Needs Tracking (INT) system was designed based on lessons learned from the FSNAU EWEA Dashboard (http://www.fsnau.org/downloads/fsnau-dashboard-linking-early-warning-early-action-somalia), the Household Economic Approach (HEA) framework, and literature on early warning systems. The INT system feeds directly into various analysis working groups, such as the the Needs Analysis Working Group (NAWG), and is accessible at any time through an online portal that is available for stakeholders to view risk levels or filter to specific sub-components or indicators.


## 3. Objectives

The INT system aims to provide the NAWG and various other key decision makers with a system that consolidates multiple data sources and critical indicators into one information management system which feeds into a classification decision tree, endorsed by the four life-saving clusters. The INT system provides the NAWG with the ability to identify counties analysis based on recent and reliable data that need further analysis and discussion before being presented to the Inter-Cluster Working Group (ICWG).

### Specific objectives

1.  To act as an information management system for multiple data sources.
2.  To use established thresholds to highlight potential areas of risks for the Needs Analysis Working Group (NAWG) to examine further.
3.  To build upon the current model by identifying key indicators that partners require in order to respond to the needs of the affected population more effectively. 

## 4. Research Questions

1. What is the current level of food insecurity (availability, access, utilisation and stability), access to livelihoods?
2. What is the current level of access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, to what degree are they utilised, and has there been water-borne related disease outbreaks that have affected the target area?
3. What is the prevalence of core diseases in a specific county (Malaria, Cholera, Acute Watery Diarrhoea, Measles)?
4. What is the prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM)?


## 5. Methodology

### Overview

The INT system is based on lessons learned from the FSNAU EWEA Dashboard. Due to the difficulty of collecting regular data, the INT system is initially designed to be a real-time needs tracking system of current data to provide the various analysis groups with up to date information regarding the risk of increasing needs, rather than to provide projections or forecast of needs. However, as the system grows and data sources improve, a second objective of the INT is to document and analyse long-term data to anticipate better and monitor deterioration and provide early warning guidance. The system draws on literature on Famine indicators and the interaction between the four conceptual indicators included (FSL, WASH, Health, and Nutrition). The INT system is not expected to be used independently of further analysis or discussion to trigger a response, preferably to be included in the NAWG system for recommendations to the ICWG and HCT for response scale-up.

### The Integrated Needs Tracking System concept

As the dynamic and volatile nature of the humanitarian crisis continues, availability and use of a practical needs monitoring system that integrates available data sources and flags, as well as, predicts the needs of areas experiencing worsening humanitarian conditions in-between IPC analyses. All the while making use of this Information management (IM) platform and framework for understanding multi-sectoral 'real time' needs by pulling together data from multiple sources, including FSNMS, SMART, Health, REACH AoK, REACH JMMI, and remote sensing.

The INT system is designed to assist the various analysis groups in identifying potential 'hotspot' counties based on sectoral or overall needs on a monthly basis. The INT uses data that is mainly captured at the settlement or county level. While this data may be considered lower quality, the data is released on a monthly basis, allowing for regular updates between major data releases from the IPC/FSNMS/SMART surveys. The INT system is based on internationally recognised frameworks, protocols and lessons learned documents. Currently, the system focuses on four life-saving clusters; FSL, WASH, Nutrition and Health. It focuses on drivers and outcomes to help distinguish how multiple indicators interact with each other when determining the needs of a particular area. Currently, the INT system focuses on four categories, FSL, WASH, Health, and Nutrition with components and sub-components for each category. The INT system uses a threshold approach (with tiered aggregation) to classify the various categories and components as 'Low’, 'Moderate', 'High’, or 'Very High' risk. When possible, thresholds are determined by pre-established thresholds, such as the IPC for food security outcome indicators, or based on technical feedback from sector experts and previous trends.

The INT will have a publicly available online dashboard that will be built to allow the user to "unpack" the alert levels, to see what indicator(s) is driving the status. Unpacking alert levels allow the user to make their interpretation of the warning and ensure all actors have the opportunity to verify the accuracy of the alert and ensure there is no mis-prioritisation based on the system.

Overall, the INT system is designed to bridge the gap between large-scale assessments, such as SMART and FSNMS, and analysis periods, such as the IPC. This will allow for the various analysis groups and partners to understand underlying trends and areas of concern on a regular monthly basis, providing a better source for the NAWG to provide the ICWG evidence-based recommendations.

### County Classification and Indicators

The four conceptual indicators, FSL, WASH, Health, and Nutrition have been agreed upon with cluster representatives, and are strongly influenced by the UNICEF conceptual framework.[^1] The UNICEF framework uses four categories, basic causes, underlying causes, immediate causes and manifestation. As the situation deteriorates, basic causes influence underlying causes which in turn have immediate causes which finally manifest into malnutrition. The INT system follows a similar approach by examining 'drivers', such as limited financial access to markets or poor WASH infrastructure, which are considered to be among the root causes of outcome indicators, such as malnutrition and mortality. Note that within the INT framework, malnutrition is treated as both an outcome and an influencer, since a high prevalence of malnutrition increases morbidity, reduces food utilising and decreases household productivity.[^2]

[^1]: Developed in 1998 the UNICEF conceptual framework for malnutrition still plays a fundamental role in multiple frameworks and analysis protocols, including the IPC. https://www.unicef.org/sowc98/silent4.htm)
[^2]: Malnutrition and mortality are usually closely linked. Acute protein-energy malnutrition mainly leads to death by increasing the susceptibility of malnourished individuals to infectious diseases and, once infected, increasing the severity and duration of these diseases.

The INT system classifies counties, using the four conceptual indicators, with data into one of four classifications; Low, Moderate, High, and Very High needs, and another classification for counties with insufficient data, see Table 1 for description of the classifications. Classifications are based on the number of components and sub-components that are being triggered based on a variety of indicators. A county-level emergency ‘Confirmed’ reflects the presence of a NAWG trigger (such as GAM above 15% or populations in Phase 5 Food Insecurity); reflecting the outcomes from underlying causes or drivers has already had a significant impact on the county. A county-level ‘Very High’ classification reflects a preponderance of risk for ‘Very High’ needs at the conceptual indicator (or sector) level, while High, Moderate, and Low county classifications follow the same logic. In the case of a ‘Very High’ or ‘High’ classification, the INT system is triggering based on ‘Very High’ or ‘High’ needs based on underlying causes or drivers that lead to excess malnutrition and mortality. Therefore, it is probable that action is recommended to address the underlying needs of the county, either through FSL, WASH, Health, Nutrition or a combination of the above. The annexe provides more details on the decision tree for each conceptual indicator and components, along with a detailed guide on indicators used.

### Level of analysis

Although specific geographic tracking of needs would be ideal, currently the availability of reliable and timely data sources used for the INT system is collected at the county level. Therefore, the map is disaggregated to the county level and cannot provide information on essential needs at the sub-county level. However, the system is designed to allow users to unpack county classifications by conceptual indicators through examining the associated components and sub-components. Unpacking allows the user to make their own interpretation of the classification and ensure that all actors have the opportunity to verify the accuracy of the information, further ensuring that there is no mis-prioritisation based on the system. For example, a decision maker may only be interested in where there are WASH emergencies and can therefore filter for only WASH indicators.

### Components and sub-components

The system uses a threshold mechanism to determine each classification based on whether a set number of components and sub-components that are triggered based on pre-established thresholds. The thresholds are based on previous frameworks, including the IPC, WFP VAM’s CARI model, FAOs EWEA models for Somalia and technical expert advice. For example, when available FSL indicators follow the IPC or HEA established thresholds. Following internationally recognised norms ensures the system follows best practices. When previously established thresholds or expertise advise is unavailable, trend analysis is used to gauge appropriate thresholds. Additionally, every six months when FSNMS and SMART survey data is available for the majority of the country, this data is used and can override other monthly data due to its high relevance and reliability. The annexe provides a general outline of the conceptual indicators the respective components and sub-components.


### Data Reliability

INT indicators are chosen based on key criteria:

#### Timeliness

The fundamental mandate of the integrated needs track system is to provide a countrywide analysis of the critical needs in South Sudan on a monthly basis. As a result, it is crucial that the indicators used are collected on a regular and predictable basis, allowing for the timely release of the INT system each month and enabling trend analysis.

#### Level of analysis/sampling methodology

Data must be representative or able to be extrapolated to the county level. Specific geographic needs tracking is crucial, however, at its current status, the INT system focuses primarily on county- level needs and data sources. If two datasets are collected within the same time frame and have representative data, the INT focal points and NAWG members to examine which data should be used based on the quality of the survey conducted. HH level data sources, such as FSNMS and SMART surveys, are recognised for providing critical information that is representative of the target population. However, due to the temporal inconsistencies between data collection periods, the information cannot always be used in the INT system.

### Data sources

The INT system relies on several different data sources, each aligned with specific conceptual indicators and meet the criteria above. Many of these data sources are collected and therefore can be updated on a monthly basis. The indicator guide within the documentation tab provides the data source, level of analysis, and timeliness of every indicator.

For example:

- Rainfall historical anomalies collected by Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data and WFP VAM’s Dataviz portal[^3]. This information highlights dry spells and excessive rainfall and is considered a key indicator for understanding both current and future needs in a location. Droughts have significant effects on livestock, and flooding can lead to spikes in vector and waterborne diseases.[^4]
- AoK, while not representative at the HH level, provides consistent monthly data on a broad variety of indicators, predominantly within the FSL component.
- Admission rates into nutrition feeding programmes and health clinics are reported each month and therefore can support the health component being regularly updated and provide support to nutrition through the number of children treated for malnourishment.
- Collection of market prices on a monthly basis by WFP VAM, and REACH through the Joint Market Monitoring Initiative (JMMI), allows anomalies in market indicator prices to be highlighted[^3].

### Updating the INT system

The INT system is updated on a monthly cycle by INT technical focal points. All indicators and data sources were chosen based on timely collection periods and reliability. The foundation of the INT system is to be updated on a monthly basis, allowing for continuous monitoring of counties between major surveys and workshops, such as the IPC.



### Future Concepts

#### Shocks index

REACH has already begun to look at how different shocks affects populations through the implementation of shocks related questions in the AoK questionnaire and the April 2018 report on shocks. The report, in particular, analysed how shocks can have varying geographic and social implications. FGD participants discussed how rarely is it a one-off shock that pushes populations to the break of destitution, but a combination of shocks occurring simultaneous of within short time- periods of each other. As a result, there is a need to continue to monitor shocks and understand the implications of each type of shock. Currently, the INT system uses the REACH AoK shock questions to gauge the effects of perceived shocks, such as the effect of an increase in cereal price on a settlement's ability to access food (see indicator guide). However, further research and understanding of these concepts will be explored under a DFID funded grant and implemented into the INT system, via a shocks index.

#### Trend analysis

As the INT system cumulates data and it will become possible to analyse trends across counties. While it is difficult to obtain reliable baselines in South Sudan, some data sources can be compared against time to understand and monitor over time various indicators. Ideally, trend analysis would allow the INT system to flag counties that may not have surpassed certain thresholds but have been quickly deteriorating or improving versus previous months.

#### Bi-annual recalibration

The lower reliability tree is the foundation of the INT system, allowing for monthly updates between IPC updates and ad-hoc SMART surveys. However, we possible, using data from HH level surveys and outcomes from IPC analysis will be used to help recalibrate thresholds and indicators to assure that the INT system aligns correctly with higher reliable data and can be adjusted for seasonality.
